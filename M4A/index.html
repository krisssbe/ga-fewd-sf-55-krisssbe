    <p class="vision" >We are using 1,5 x earth’s resources every year. By 2050 this will be 3x if we continue living the way we do. 2 out of 5 kids still will never set foot in a classroom, the rich are getting richer, the poor poorer and there is continued high unemployment in one area where there are skills shortages in others. 

    If we approach these problems the way we have, they won’t get resolved. We need something new, we need disruption, we need to use technology, a fresh way of thinking, we need global players, who understand the local space. This is how Match4Action was born.

    We offer a smart technology platform using the latest machine learning and artificial intelligence to match the demand for resources for social impact with the skills and resources available,  anywhere in the world. We will use blockchain to create and  manage a social impact currency, which will be the financial resource used in a similar way to carbon credits.

    Match4Action connects those volunteering their skills with those in need for remote or local project support, advice, collaboration and mentoring. It will take advantage of virtual assistants to plan and match available resources and skills with project needs.

    This unique self sustainable open platform has one key purpose, accelerating social impact through collaboration and linking local projects with global our presence.</p>
